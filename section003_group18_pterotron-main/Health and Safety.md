# Health and Safety


Health and safety is the key to a succesful project regardless of the field of work. In order to esnure the safety of everybody working with the project during development, testing, and the final competition throughout the compotition. 

## General Procedures

1. **Workplace Awareness:**

    - All team members must be made aware of the emergency exits and location of the the nearest extringuishers and first aid kits

    - Additionally, a walthrough for all members of the team of the workspace, points of exits, and other critical safety resources is crucial to ensuring the safety of everyone involved

    - Scheduling regular check-ins to discuss concerns, updates, or incidents

    
2. **Training and Safety Protocalls:**
    - Ensure that all members of the team have recieved proper training to work the the components and machines that are required for the project

    - Provide oppurtunities for further education on safe use of tools and equipment that will be present in the workspace

**Design and Prototyping Safety**
1. **Handling Electrical Components:**
    - Improper handling of many electrical components can cause serious harm to humans in the form of electrical shocks

    - To ensure the safety of all team members batteries must always be disconnected and powered off when not in use, *especially when working with the electrical equipment*
    
    - Use insulated tools when handling electrical components to reduce the risk of shock or short-circuiting.
    
    - Conduct circuit tests on a breadboard before integrating electrical components into the final prototype to verify correct operation.

2. **Battery Safety:**
    - Exsessive overheating, incorrect wiring, or improper operating conditions can cause significant fire risks and chemical hazards if not effectively dealt with.

    - The use of a voltage deviding battery monitoring system will allow the team to monitor the batteries health - reducing the risk of overcharging or discharging the battery.

    - Batteries should be inspected on a per workshop basis for visible damage or signs of leaks which could pose a hazard for users.

    - Batteries should only be charged by the provided, previously approved chargers, and must be monitored while charging.

3. **Machinery Safety**
    
    - The improper use of tools and heavy machinery can lead to a variety of injuries

    - It is crucial that all tools used over the course of the semester ( soldering irons, CNC machines, laser cutting machines, screw drivers, utilities knives, etc..) are used for thier intended purpose and follow the manufacturers operating procedures

    - Personnel protected equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times when operating the machinery to reduce risk of injury

    - Stores should be stored securely and orderly as to prevent any accidental injuries caused by improper storage

4. **Moving Parts**
    
    - Moving parts, such as motors, actuators, and gears, can pose a risk of pinching or injuring team members during operation.

   - Test moving parts in a controlled and safe environment before full operation.

   - Label and mark hazardous areas around moving parts with clear warnings to alert team members.

   - Install covers or guards around moving components to shield personnel from potential injuries while the robot is in operation.
