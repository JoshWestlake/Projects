The following table highlights the FRDPARRC analysis that has been used to evaluate the teams strategy and conceptual ideas for the project:


|                          | Functional Requirements | Design Parameters                  | Analysis | References | Risk | Countermeasures |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|------------|------|-----------------|
| **Strategy**             |      Score by collecting all the dinosours                   | Collect the dinosours 1 at a time      |     Requires high operations speed and control to precisely grab each and every dinosuar within a limit time span 1 by 1     |    **LINKS**         | Collecting 1 dinosour at a time is time consuming and will require more precision and more accuracy from the driver and robot controlls system |    Implement a bulldozer on the front of the robot allowing the robot to push multiple items into a more oppurtune area for collection             | We will develop a high speed robot with an emphasis on control to allow quick collection of dinosours. additionally a small dozer will be placed on the front of the robot to allow it to move more that one to a desired location for easier collection.
| **Concept**              |    Collecting one dinosour at a time and deposit them 1 by 1                       | 1. Will require a rather advanced and easily controlled robotic arm that will pick up the dinosours<br><br> 2. Will need to have the a bull dozer allowing it to manouvre the dinos into more advantageous positions for collection<br><br> 3.   Need to take advantage of the smaller size of the robot in order to reach the more difficult dinos that a larger robot may not be able to access |1. Need to consider: Required Torque, linkage design, and gripper design (end effector) <br><br>2. Need to consider the size, and optimal orientation/shape for the bull dozer.<br><br> 3. Must consider the size, and materials avalible         |      1. APSC 182 knowledge, MREN 348 Knowledge, Basic laws of physics <br><br> 2. Online heavy machinery design and different bull dozer configurations <br><br> 3.   Consult the provided equipment, investigate the size of the game board, etc.    | 1. Designing a arm that requires more torque then the provided servos can provide <br><br> 2. If to large it may interfere with the arm mechanism or could cause issue accessing parts of the gameboard. <br><br> 3. Over estimate the provided materials and end up with a design that cannot be produced    |    1. Do torque calculations to ensure that the arm will be capable to mavouvering the load with the given servo <br><br> 2. Decide upon the arm configuration before designing the bull dozer to ensure they will fit together, also ensure to chech dimensions of the game board <br><br>3. Verify material being used during design phase             |
