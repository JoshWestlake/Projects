1. **What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables,
what are your own goals?**
    - Write the code to control all the sensors and motors specific functions for the robot
    - Become familiar the Autodesk Fusion and begin 3D printing gripper prototypes for the robot

2. **What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?**
    - The team has to design the gripper for the robot in Autodesk Fusion and 3D print a few test prototypes to make sure the design will work as intended
    - Present the finished cardboard prototype
    - Use the given test sample codes for the sensors and motors and then use and build off of them to create the final code for each part to control the robot
