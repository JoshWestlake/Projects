2.2 Design Round 2 Scrum Planning

1. **What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables,
what are your own goals?**
    - Write the code to control all the sensors and motors specific functions for the robot
    - Become familiar the Autodesk Fusion and begin 3D printing gripper prototypes for the robot

2. **What are the backlog items from last round?**
    - Our team still has to present the cardboard prototype from Round 1 because Paul joined the team late so the due date was extended

3. **What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?**
    - The team has to design the gripper for the robot in Autodesk Fusion and 3D print a few test prototypes to make sure the design will work as intended
    - Present the finished cardboard prototype
    - Use the given test sample codes for the sensors and motors and then use and build off of them to create the final code for each part to control the robot

4. **Who is responsible for each task/goal?**
    - Both team members are going to be designing robot parts for printing
    - Josh will write the code for the sensors and motors
    - Paul will complete the documentation
    
2.3 Health and Safety Considerations

During Round 1, your team developed an initial health and safety plan. Please take the opportunity to
review the plan and revise if necessary. Is there anything that you learned in the last two weeks that you
would like add or revise? Do you have any new mitigation plans for some of the risks?
After reviewing and reflecting on the plan, please add a statement to indicate that:
1. **your team has reviewed the plan at the beginning of Round 2**
    - The plan has been reviewed again for Round 2 and all the health and safety protocols are still being followed
2. **affirm that your team is meeting or not meeting the plan (all or some aspects), and**
    - The team is still meeting the plan
3. **summarize any changes you have made.**
    - No changes have been made to the plan as nothing new needs to be added because the original plans already took everything into account
4. **If you are not meeting some aspect of the plan, please add why and what you plan to do differently**
    - All aspects are being met
