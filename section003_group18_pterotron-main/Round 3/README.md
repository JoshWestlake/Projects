1. **What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?**
    - To have all the robot CAD parts ready for lasercutting/printing.
    - Begin putting the robot together 
    - 3D print and test a gripper prototype to make sure it works and fits on the arm



2. **What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?**

    - Finish designing all the parts for the robot in Solidworks or Fusion
    - Begin 3D printing or lasercutting the parts, including a gripper prototype
    - Laser cut the base of the robot and begin putting the breadboard and other components on it
    
3. **Who is responsible for each task/goal?**

    - Paul will write the documentation
    - Josh will make the electric schematic
    - Paul will design and 3D print the gripper
    - Josh will design and 3D print the arm
    - Both will put the parts together and start building the robot
