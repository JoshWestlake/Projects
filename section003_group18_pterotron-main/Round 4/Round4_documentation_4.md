#What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this round’s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?

    - Finish 3D print the remaining parts required for the robot such as the gripper and parts of the arm.

#What are the backlog items from last round?

    - The gripper was intended to be printed last round, however due to printer problems it has not been done yet.

#What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?

    - Print the gripper and other parts using a different 3D printer.

#Who is responsible for each task/goal?

    - Paul and Josh will both try to print the parts.

#Design for Sustainability


Every 3D print and laser cut has a cost in the form of resources and power and the more each is consumed, the less sustainable the design becomes. Printing or cutting multiple prototypes and design ideas for testing wastes time and resources so to avoid excessive use of these machines and to maintain a more sustainable design process, the team always ensures that a part is finalized before its creation. Ideally, a part will only have to be made once for it to work, however this is not always the case and there maybe be other problems that arise. Using biodegradable materials for printing or cutting can lessen the carbon footprint made from each part, allowing for more testing and prototyping while keeping sustainable design principles. Another solution is to reuse past designs instead of throwing them away and building off of them rather than restarting from nothing so that less overall materials are used. The overall goal is to reduce material waste and costs and these methods help to achieve that.
