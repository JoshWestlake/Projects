# Design Round 5
- [Round 5 Scrum Planning](Round5_documentation_5.md)
- [Round 5 Programs](/Round%205/Round_5_Programs)

# Overall Strategy

## Autonomous Mode
- The robot will autonomously navigate using the line following sensor which had been mounted to the bottom of the robot using a custom 3D printed Piece. 
- It will employ a PI controller allowing it to accurately and smoothly follow the line and rapidly travel to the gate with more consistancy then using the button press method

## Manual Mode
- The robot will be focused on:
    1. Collecting Minions (highest priority)
    2. Collecting Dinosours 
    3. Collecting Ken (lowest priority)
