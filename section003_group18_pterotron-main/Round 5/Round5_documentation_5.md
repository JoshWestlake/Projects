# What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this round’s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?

    - Finalize the gripper design, 3D print it and connect it to the robot.
    - Strengthen the arm supports on the robot to ensure it can support the gripper.
    - Integrate line following sensor into the current controls program
    

# What are the backlog items from last round?

    - 3D printing the gripper and attaching it to the robot.
    - Initialize the line following sensor


# What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?

    The arms on the robot may be swapped from 3D printed pieces to stronger lasercut pieces to make it sturdier.
    Gripper will be printed and attached to the end of the robot's arm using screws.

# Who is responsible for each task/goal?

    Josh will print the gripper 
    Josh will initialize and integrate the autonomous mode using the line following sensor
    Paul will attach the gripper to the arm

# Workshop 9.2 – Mobile Robot Initial Thoughts  

The current iteration of the robot is performing sufficiently as expected, successfully navigating the game board and accessing different areas without becoming stuck. During testing, the team encountered minor timeout errors where the robot occasionally lost communication with the controller. When this occurred, the robot would continue executing its last received command, often leading to unintended movements or malfunctions. This resulted in input delay causing the robot to drift in one direction. Addressing this issue will be a key focus as the competition date approaches. On a positive note, the wheel size and marble placement functioned as anticipated, enabling smooth movement and minimizing unwanted friction from additional contact points.  

Moving forward, the team’s primary focus will be on refining the arm mechanism. There are concerns about how the robot’s balance is affected by the arm’s positioning, particularly when operating under load. Ensuring stability and reliability in these conditions will be crucial for optimizing performance in future iterations.
